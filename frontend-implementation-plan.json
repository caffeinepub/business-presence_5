Ensure the z-index is set appropriately (e.g., z-40 or z-50) so the widget appears above page content but does not conflict with the Navigation bar. Verify that the circular photo, glow ring animation, and owner name label remain visually intact and fully visible in the new top-right position. Test across desktop and mobile viewports to confirm the widget does not overlap the Navigation bar's interactive elements (links, cart/wishlist icons)."
