# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add shopping cart, wishlist, place order flow with address and UPI payment, and update business details across the Melt & Glow site.

**Planned changes:**
- Add three action elements below each product card's price: a "Place Order" button, an "Add to Cart" button, and a Wishlist heart icon button — all styled in the warm terracotta/sand theme
- Add a slide-out cart drawer showing added items with product name, price, quantity controls, subtotal, and item removal
- Add a wishlist panel listing saved products with name and price; heart icon toggles filled/unfilled state; items can be removed
- Clicking "Place Order" opens a modal/form collecting: full name, street address, city/town, PIN code, and phone number (all fields validated)
- After the address form, display a UPI-only payment section with a UPI ID or QR code placeholder (no card, net banking, or COD options)
- Update About section text to "It Is My Dream Business"
- Update location to "Diamond Harbour, Falta" in footer and/or contact section
- Update contact phone number to "+91 86173 76874" in footer and contact section
- Update service tagline to "Glow Your Beautiful Moments" in the hero, services section, or footer

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can add candles to a cart or wishlist, place an order by filling in their address and selecting UPI payment, and see updated business details including location, phone, and tagline.
